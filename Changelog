SNA_AutoEnc_1.0
	No major changes
	Comments added (see comments for future work)
	Training dataset and # epochs reduced for testing
	
SNA_Unet_0.2
	Fixed saved model loading (missing)
	Added testing output to training set building
	
SNA_Unet_0.3
	Includes (1,1) transpose conv layer
	Working Unet for single images
	Needs a lot of cleaning up
	
SNA_Unet_1.0
	Without (1,1) transpose conv layer
	Cleanup
	Added monitor metric to model.compile() (Unet.compile())/
	Added earlystopping callback
	
SNA_Unet_1.1
	# replace maxpooling with convolutions with stride = 2, also more informed downsampling
	# NEED a convolution bottom of U. This is the most compressed version of your input. It builds the latent space.
	Lowered total number of filters (removed the 32 filter convolution at either end deeper than the 64)
	model checkpoints: save weights only, every 10 epochs now instead of best
	still need to go back and fix the normalisation
	
SNA_Unet_1.2
	Duplicate to run different lines
	Might have changed batch size to 4
	
SNA_Unet_1.3
	Changed normalization to customizable (for [-1,1])
	Added noisy test dataset
		Gaussian noise added prior to normalization with same
	Working on GPU
	
SNA_Unet_1.4
	the model.fit broke after installing pydot and graphviz
	Try copying over environment I saved last night
	Does not have to do with the skip connections
	conda list --revisions
	conda install --rev 12
	May need to uninstall with pip from cmd

	Nick ‘cudart64_100.dll’ from cuda download
	jupyter notebook "C:\Users\fmdel\OneDrive - University of Leeds\2021 Sem 1\HALLIBURTON\Code\SNA_Unet_1.4_testing.ipynb"
	
SNA_Unet_1.5
	Don't trust the loss against test set. Only the first channel was working
	
SNA_Unet_1.6
	Messing around with channel input, not sure if functional this version
	Only 1 skip connection
	
SNA_Unet_1.7
	2 skip connections
	4 channel input working
	Also saves test and train data
	Elapsed time: 12417.962851285934
	BOTH SKIP CONNETIONS
	

SNA_Unet_1.8
	No skip connections
	I believe results should be the same as any of the above with working channel input, but just use this. Don't trust saved models before 1.7 that supposedly use channelled input (or test the prediction on 2nd channel if you do. Only 1st channel of training data was being filled earlier)
	NO SKIP CONNETIONS
	
SNA_Unet_1.9
	1 lower skip connection
	Same as 1.6 but functional
	Added histogram_freq=1 to TB callback
	BOTTOM SKIP CONNETION
	
SNA_Unet_1.10
	Back to adding synthetic noise (noise_factor = 1)
	Changed data slicing to happen right after reading
	NOISE ADDED AFTER NORMALIZATION
	BOTTOM SKIP CONNETION
	
SNA_Unet_2.0
	Removed +1 from prep data
	Bad result: output is 4 channels
	NO SKIP CONNECTIONS

SNA_Unet_2.1
	Trim all lines to same shape
	L2 loss still
	NO SKIP CONNECTIONS
	
SNA_Unet_2.2
	
	BOTTOM SKIP CONNETION
	L1 loss MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR
	
Loader_1.9
	Data truncation prior to slicing for compatibility
	While loop should have always been up to numimg + i_start. Changed.
	Made training/test dataset generation a callable function
		Remember I have not been seeding noise. Maybe why difference panels show leakage
		FIXED TO INCLUDE SEEDED NOISE IN FUNCTION
			Theoretically if I end up going with adding noise after can take make 3D noise array
		
SNA_Unet_2.3
	BOTTOM SKIP CONNECTION
	L2 loss
	Compare to 2.2

SNA_Unet_2.4
	BOTH SKIP CONNECTIONS
	L1 Loss
	
SNA_Unet_2.5
	
	Bottom Skip Connection
	L1 loss
	Added noise (normed then summed)  # no I didn’t
		Doesn't work, even if noise scaled to minmax of data
		Elaradat histogram looks far from gaussian
	Edited prepdata noise addition to reflect this^  # no I didn’t
	
SNA_Unet_1.9.2
	Added noisy validation (is this right?)
		probably not
		
SNA_Unet_2.4_LOADER
	need to change writefig model_differences_rgb to image_array
	Added functions to do stuff
	Saves predicted images
		Good images to denoise: 67?, 68, 69, 70, 71
			3, 4, 
			60 good to show salt and pepper
		Gain = 10
		64, 66 is a different issue
		Use 65 to show no damage to signal?
	
SNA_Unet_2.6
	Setting seed every time prepdata is called is not appropriate for noisy training data if also noisy test data
	
SNA_Unet_4.0
	Deep Image Priors: 1 network per 1 image
	3 Generators, function version (3rd) working
	A detailed example of data generators with Keras (stanford.edu)
	Keras data generators and how to use them | by Ilya Michlin | Towards Data Science
	Data timesamples quartered to fit in gpu
	Changed gif tagging
	Changed some data.shape[]'s to x_test.shape's. Should just make image dims variable
	
SNA_Unet_5.0
	Ran with num_std_clip = 100 so as not to remove any data (assume you have done)
	Bottom skip connection
	L2 norm
	Mae, mse metric
	# Csvlog wasn’t working so changed to append=True 
	seisspace speckled noise add noise module
	Num_std_clip = 9 
	
SNA_Unet_5.1
	1 channel
	Num_std_clip = 8 
	L2 norm
	Stopped saving input_data_scaled separately
	If you minmax scale to very similar amplitudes it will have a hard time recovering that relation, they will contribute minorly to the loss
		Maybe a good thing? Yes. I'll go with that
		
SNA_Unet_5.2
	5.0 duplicate but with working csv and num_std_clip = 8
	L2 norm
SNA_Unet_5.3
	L1 norm
	num_std_clip = 8
	
SNA_Unet_5.*.2
	5.1, 5.2, 5.3 re-run to normalize output prior to learning
	
SNA_Unet_5.1.3
	5.1 and 5.1.2 were erroneously predicting the 4th channel of 5.2/5.3 prediction, but plots were not taking that into account. Truncated last 3 from 5.1 dataset loading to avoid confusion. This shouldn't affect training, but just to be safe
	
SNA_Unet_5.4,5,6
	5.1,2,3 output to output

SNA_Unet_5.*.2_LOADER
	Allows prediction of raw data, labelled with suffix ypred
	This is going to take some serious work to sort out the predict, diffto, x_test, y_test mess
		

PLAN
	Functionality for Varying size lines (make use of all Elaradat data, regardless of trimming to fit GPU RAM)
	Should change input/output to use numchan
	Zoom in
	Trim time?
	Spectra. Cant do FK on all datasets, can do power 
	Zoom in on spike
	try same panels with and without noisy test
	
Reboot: 29, 21
working on 20
